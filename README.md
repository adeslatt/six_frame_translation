Six frame translation - as a container attribution [Long-Read-Proteogenomics/modules/six_frame_translation](https://github.com/sheynkman-lab/Long-Read-Proteogenomics#readme)


Pulled this out from the nextflow workflow so masterfully created by Ben Jordan of the Sheynkman Lab

*--------------------------------------------------
Six-Frame Translation
 * Generates a fasta file of all possible protein sequences
 * derivable from each PacBio transcript, by translating the
 * fasta file in all six frames (3+, 3-). This is used to examine
 * what peptides could theoretically match the peptides found via
 * a mass spectrometry search against GENCODE.
